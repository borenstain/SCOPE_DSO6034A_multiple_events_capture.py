# SCOPE_DSO6034A_multiple_events_capture.py
Script captures electronic signal of a randomly occurring multiple events using a single channel of Agilent made DSO6034A oscilloscope.  Get the data into an array, scales and saves it ones, at the end, in a csv file.  Name of file is the date and time at the start of the test. At the beginning of the data of each event, there is a time stamp from the beginning of the run. The RUN/STOP of scope need to be in red. The trigger should be set above the maximum regularly occurring signal (seam). Or, it should be set at the two or three times the standard deviation of the background signal. It is possible to change trigger or scale of channel while running to adjust the signal into scale. That is because program gets scaling information (so called "pre_amble") for every event. Script is based on InfiniiVision_Analog_Waveform_Grab_Elegant.py
